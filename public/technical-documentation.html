        <p>Adding a fitness routine into your lifestyle can greatly improve 
          your health and quality of life. The benefits to your heart, muscular system
          and mind are many. Let's learn how to get started with fitness and exercise.

          Getting Started
        </header>
        <p>The best approach to getting started with exercise is to get into 
          a routine that you can follow and incorporate around your current lifestyle.
          Make sure you set health and fitness goals that are realistic and achieveable.
        </p><!--paragraph 2-->
        <p>You will need to consider factors such as work, family and other commitments before you
          decide on when and what you will spend your time on in the gym. Pick a time that works well
          consistently for your schedule.
        </p><!--paragraph 3-->
        <p>Another important factor to consider is exercise intensity. Many people start exercising at
          intensities too high for them to maintain, making them feel unmotivated and exercise feel too hard.

          <ul>
            <li>Scheduling your exercise time around your current schedule and picking
            an exercise routine that aligns with your goals without taking up too much of
            your time. 
            </li> 
            <li>Start an exercise program that is at a manageable intensity. You want a program that
              you can stick to for a long period of time.

          Resistance Training
        </header>
        <p>Resistance training is an essential part of any fitness routine. Resistance training
          aids in musclular strength and <em>hypertrophy</em> &#40;muscle growth&#41;. Resistance training
          is performed by stressing the muscular system under load &#40;aka resistance&#41;.
        </p><!--paragraph 6-->
        <p>
          Strength can be built by performing exercises in line with your goals under a heavy load
          with few repitions, typically in the 1 to 5 repitition range. For the best results, compund exercises
          should be used while building strength like this. The load should not be so heavy that 
          it compromises form. Exercises are clustered into sets with 2 to five minutes rest in between.
          Resistance training like this is not optimal for building muscle.
        </p><!--paragraph 7-->
        <p>Muscle building works best with a light to moderate load placed on the muscle. For <em>best results</em>
        it is recommended to focus on a mix of isolation exercises and compund movements. Repitions are higher for building muscle.
        6 to 12 repititions are great for building a mix of muscle and stength. 12 repitions and up are great for building
        muscle endurance.</p><!--paragraph 8-->
        <p>Building muscle and strength is essential for preventing injury and maintaining balance and coordination
          as you age.<!--paragraph 9-->
        </p>
        <p>Resistance training can be divided into many different training splits. Three to four days a week for resistance training is more than enough
          to provide the necessary adaptations to help you reach your goals.
        </p><!--paragraph 10-->
        <p>It is recommended to find a <a href="www.pumpdfitness.co.za" target="_blank">good coach<a></a> before starting out with compound lifting,
        to ensure safety and proper form.</p><!--paragraph 11-->

        <code><label>Examples of compound exercises:</label>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Squat</li>
          <li>Deadlift</li>

          Cardiovascular Training
        </header>
        <p>Cardiovascular training increases the effeciency of the heart, lungs and
          vascular system &#40;the network of blood vessels throughout the body&#41;.
        </p><!--paragraph 12-->
        <p>For the best health and fitness results a mix of low and high intensity 
          cardio training should be incorporated into your program. Majority of your training 
          should be spent doing zone two cardio, while the higher intensity zone 5 cardio 
          should be reserved for short bursts at the end of your work out. Zone 2 and zone 5 
          refers to different heart rate zones.
        </p><!--paragraph 13-->
        <label>Zone 2 cardio training:</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Low intensity workouts that raise the heart rate and can be maintained for a long
            period of time.
          </li>
          <li>Breathing should be steady and you should be able to uncomfortably maintain a conversation
            during your training session.
          </li>
          <li>Increases the hearts maximum capacity to fill and pump blood, making the heart more efficient.</li>
        </ul>
          <code><label>30 to 120 minutes of zone 2 cardio three to six times per week is recommended. 
            Exercises that are best for zone 2 training:</label>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Walking/Hiking</li>
              <li>Jogging</li>
              <li>Cycling</li>
              <li>Rowing</li>
            </ul></code>
        
        <label>Zone 5 cardio training:</label>
        <ul>
          <li>High intensity training reserved for the end of a training session.</li>
          <li>Breathing should be hard and uncomfortable. Aim for just below the threshold of
            maximum effort.
          </li>
          <li>Roughly only 5 minutes of zone 5 cardio three times per week is needed for good results.
            Sprinting intervals or tabata are great options for zone 5 cardio.
          </li>
          <li>Zone 5 cardio increases the strength and force of the muscle contractions that the heart uses to
            pump blood. Zone 2 cardio should be your first priority, using zone 5 to make for a well rounded
            cardiovascular program.

          Recovery
        </header>
        <p>Recovery is just as important as the exercise stimulus. Exercise is voluntary stress on your body to
          achieve certain fitness adaptations and goals. Recovery is an essential part of the process as these adaptations
          can only really grow during rest. </p><!--paragraph 14-->

            Body Recomposition
          </header>
          <p>Body recomposition refers to weight loss and muscle gain. Both of these require you to take a look at your nutition.</p><!--paragraph 15-->
          <p>Weight loss does not necessarily require an exercise stimulus. The most important factor
            if your goal is losing weight is to maintain a caloric deficit. Tracking your food and your calories will
          help keep you on track and ensure your success. Check out <a id="calorie-tracker" href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_blank">MyFitnessPal</a> or <a href="https://www.loseit.com/" target="_blank">LoseIt!</a> for great calorie tracking
          apps and recourses.</p><!--paragraph 16-->
          <p>Building muscle will definitely need you to spend time in the gym. <a href="#resistance_training">Resistance training</a> paired with a high protein diet
            and a caloric surplus will give you the right stimulus to grow. Aim for 2g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day and 
            use a calorie tracker to track your weight gain and progress.
